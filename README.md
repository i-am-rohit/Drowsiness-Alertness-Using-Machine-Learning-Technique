# Drowsiness-Alertness-Using-Machine-Learning-Technique
In India, many accidents occur every day due to breakdowns. As the population grows, so does the number of cars and accidents. Most accidents occur because people feel drowsy, speedy, drunk, or driving. Therefore, we will analyze the data of the past few years, investigate the main causes of accidents, and introduce an accident prevention system to deal with the problem of accidents caused by human sleep and drowsiness. In India, many accidents occur every day due to breakdowns. No. As the population grows, so does the number of cars and accidents. Therefore, we will introduce an accident prevention system to deal with the problem of accidents caused by drowsiness and drowsiness. As computer vision technology advances and advances, smart / smart cameras are being developed that predict driver fatigue and warn drivers. This can reduce accidents when the driver is tired. This task uses deep learning to follow a new approach to detect driver drowsiness based on the condition of the eyes while driving the vehicle. Histogram equalization and cany edge detection algorithms are used in this task to detect faces and extract eye areas from face images.
